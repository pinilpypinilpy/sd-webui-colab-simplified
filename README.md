# Simple Colab version of the amazing stable diffusion web ui repo located [here](https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui) and based off of the original Colab found [here](https://github.com/altryne/sd-webui-colab)

## Super simple to get started
1. Follow the links to accept the terms for the model and get a token, then paste it into the field below the links. 
2. Optionally enter a password for the webserver.
3. If you want easy access to the images you generate, check "mount_google_drive" then specify the location (anything after /content/drive/MyDrive/ is what you see when you open google drive normally).
4. Click the little play icon, and wait a few minutes until the "*random number*.gradio.app" link shows up at the bottom of the lines of code (you'll have to scroll a bit). If you entered a share password, the username is "webui".
