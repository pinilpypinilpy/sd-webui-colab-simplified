# Simple Colab version of the amazing stable diffusion web ui repo located [here](https://github.com/hlky/stable-diffusion) and based off of the original Colab found [here](https://github.com/altryne/sd-webui-colab)
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pinilpypinilpy/sd-webui-colab-simplified/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_WebUi_Simplified.ipynb)

## Super simple to get started
1. Follow the links at the top of the colab to accept the terms for the model and get a token, then paste it into the field below the links. 
2. Optionally enter a password for the webserver.
3. If you want easy access to the images you generate, check "mount_google_drive" then specify the location (anything after /content/drive/MyDrive/ is what you see when you open google drive normally).
4. Click the little play icon, and wait a few minutes until the "*random number*.gradio.app" link shows up at the bottom of the lines of code (you'll have to scroll a bit). If you entered a share password, the username is "webui".
